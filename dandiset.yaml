description: Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental role
  in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during behavior
  is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity in the fine-timescale
  spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population of physiologically
  identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial prefrontal cortex of
  the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales, sequentially organized
  and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated between different trajectories
  of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales, putative monosynaptic interactions
  reflected short-term plasticity in their dynamic and predictable modulation across
  various aspects of the task, beyond a statistical accounting for the effect of the
  neurons' co-varying firing rates. Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects,
  we found evidence for both firing pattern–dependent facilitation and depression,
  as well as for a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of
  postsynaptic targets.
